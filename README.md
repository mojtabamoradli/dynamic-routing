# dynamic-routing

Many JavaScript libraries and frameworks let you change the contents and URL of a web page without refreshing the page itself. React lets you do this, Vue enables you to do this, and I'm sure there are more ways to load pages within your website or web app dynamically. The main difference between this feature [Dynamic Routing] these frameworks offering vs. Static routing [which, in this case, the page refresh to change the content] is the time at which the routing takes place. Dynamic Routing load what you want to load on your page faster.
In dynamic routing, routes are initialized dynamically when the page gets rendered. With Dynamic routing, we can use route changes as the conditions and render components without completely changing the layouts or pages. This can also be known as nested routing since we are nesting routes inside sub-components.

With knowing all of this, you may want to use this feature but not use these frameworks for any reason you may have. Here is how I did it using Jquery, PHP, and plain JS.
